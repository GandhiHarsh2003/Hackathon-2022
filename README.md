#What is the project:
This is the java program that was built in the 2022 annual Hackathon of Quinnipiac University. This java program uses the Java Swing library and additional methods to match the theme of the hackathon. 
This program will inform users of the top three illnesses in the United States. All sources are mentioned in our app.
